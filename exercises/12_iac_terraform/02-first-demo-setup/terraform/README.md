# First Demo Setup
In this project the basic syntax rules of Terraform were tested using an AWS project.

The `.gitignore` file, ignores files that do not need to be checked in such as the state files, .terraform dir etc. Also, the variables are ignored because it might contain sensitive data and might be different for each team member.
