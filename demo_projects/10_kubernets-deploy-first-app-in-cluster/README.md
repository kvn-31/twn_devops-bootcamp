# Kubernetes Demo Project - Deploy Application in Cluster

The secrets are base64 encoded, but not encrypted. This is not a secure way to store secrets. In a real-world scenario, you would use a secret management tool like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
No real cluster is built using this project. It is just a demo project to show how to deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster, which is tested locally.
