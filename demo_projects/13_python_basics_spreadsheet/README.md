# Automation with Python (Spreadsheet)

This project uses a spreadsheet to test some automation with Python. The spreadsheet is a simple list of items with a quantity and a price.
The goal is to do various calculations with the data in the spreadsheet, such as
- amount of items per supplier
- list products with inventory below a certain threshold (10)
- list inventory value per supplier
- write the value of each item to a new column

The project uses the `openpyxl` library to read and write to the spreadsheet.
